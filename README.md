# Timer Decorator

Decorate any function to produce simple, high resolution logs of the time it took to complete the process.

    - uses nodejs' `process.hrtime` (i.e., not for use on the front end)
    - emits duration reports so you can time multiple processes at once


TODO:

    - Implement callback option to hook into the event listener
